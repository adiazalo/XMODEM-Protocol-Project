Circular buffer is used to control the manner in which the mutual memory locations are accessed/updated (using load & store functions) simultaneously in order to prevent the corruption of the desired order of the program.  Using memory order (relaxed, acquire and release) we are able to make this code thread safe (avoiding data race conditions) which controls how the atomic variable are being used to synchronize memory access among different threads.
